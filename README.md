# 🌱 ESP32 Environment Monitoring System
### Using ESP32 + ESP-IDF + BME280 + LTR390

◆ This project represents an exploration into embedded firmware architecture, low-power hardware design, and communication protocol integration using the ESP32 platform and the ESP-IDF framework.

---

## ◆ Project Overview
This project is an ESP32-based environment monitoring system designed to acquire environmental data from digital sensors and prepare it for network-based transmission.

The prototype was intentionally designed to demonstrate **end-to-end embedded system competence**, spanning:

> Multi Layer PCB & hardware design
> ESP-IDF firmware development
> Clean separation between drivers and application logic
> Peripheral communication via I2C
> Power supply and regulation strategy
> Scalable software architecture for future networking features

---

## ◆ Project Aims & Development Roadmap
At present, the system is 100% functional in its current scope, while the overall project aim is approximately 70% complete, with key networking features planned as the next phase.

## ✅ Completed / Implemented
- ◆ Fully operational 4-layer PCB
- ◆ ESP-IDF Super Loop Implementation

## 🚧 In Progress / Planned Enhancements
 ◆ Migration to FreeRTOS-Based Architecture
 ◆ WiFi Integration
 ◆ MQTT Communication
