# 🌱 ESP32 Environment Monitoring System
### Using ESP32 + ESP-IDF + I2C Sensors

◆ This project represents an exploration into embedded firmware architecture, low-power hardware design, and communication protocol integration using the ESP32 platform and the ESP-IDF framework.

## ◆ Project Overview

🟥 This project is a Environment Monitor prototype built using:

 - **ESP-32** & **ESP-IDF** 
 - BME280 Atmosphere Sensor
 - LTR390 UV Sensor

🟥 The objective was to to acquire environmental data from digital sensors and prepare it for network-based transmission.

This prototype is focused on:

✔ Multi-layer PCB & hardware design  </br>
✔ ESP-IDF firmware development </br>
✔ Peripheral communication via I2C </br>
✔ Power supply and regulation strategy </br>

## ◆ Current Status:
- Fully operational Embedded System from working 4 layer PCB to a running ESP-IDF Super Loop <br />

◆ Project Aims & Development Roadmap <br />
- This project was structured around incremental, demonstrable milestones, rather than a single monolithic goal.

## ✅ Completed / Implemented: 
◆ Completely Functional 4-Layer PCB <br />
◆ A running ESP-IDF based super loop <br />

## 🚧 In Progress / Planned Enhancements

◆ Migration to FreeRTOS-Based Architecture <br />
◆ WiFi Integration & MQTT Communication <br />
